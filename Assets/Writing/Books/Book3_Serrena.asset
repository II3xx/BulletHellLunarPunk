  DialogueText:
  - <i>Built of ignorance, Serrena</i>
  - Serrana was originally built in the 12th century by devout worshippers of the
    Equilibrium and was named as such due to the serenity the city was meant to create,
    but other than that, most of the city's early years have been lost to history.
  - 'It is believed that before the 14th century that the city was run by the church,
    since the oldest surviving records of the city''s existence mention that new
    political powers outside those of worship were rising. '
  - 'This led to many extremist religious groups to try and revolt and overthrow
    the new government. But to no avail.  '
  - "In the city\u2019s later years, Serrena has now become one of the first cities
    to harbing a new coming age of technology but still struggles with rampant corruption
    to this very day. "
