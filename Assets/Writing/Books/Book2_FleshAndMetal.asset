  DialogueText:
  - <i>The Flesh and the Metal</i>
  - 'While there are many Aeons of varying power and influence, none have been as
    influential in humanities upbringing and none have had as much hatred for each
    other as Thalassa, the Aeon of Flesh and its opposite Argyria, the Aeon of Metal. '
  - 'Thalassa is said to be the mother of flesh magic and sentient life. Argyria
    on the other hand is called the harbinger of technology.  '
  - '<i>Sevaral pages seem to be missing</i>



'
  - 'These two Aeons have been said to be at eachothers throats since time immemorial
    but without either of them, humanity would not be what we are today. '
