  DialogueText:
  - <i>The Beginning of Equilibrium</i>
  - 'When the universe came to exist, there was nothing but chaos. Infantile beings
    of the dark roamed without purpose. '
  - Many millennia passed by with none of it changing, and chaos still reigning supreme.
    But in an otherworldly flash of light, the first of the Aeons emerged.
  - 'It sought out to purge all chaos and bring order to all of existence, and in
    mere hours it was successful. All of reality was now all in its grasp.  '
  - 'It began creating more aeons that would aid in the sculpting of its perfect
    world. Each and every Aeon were to have its equal, another Aeon that ruled over
    its opposite as to keep everything in order.  '
  - "When all of the new Aeons were created and its perfect world sculpted however,
    The first Aeon, now known as \u201CThe Equilibrium\u201D, vanished, never to
    be seen again.  "
  - 'It is said that the day the Equilibrium gets its equal is the day the world
    meets its end.  '
