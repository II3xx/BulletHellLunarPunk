  - <i>You hack into the Renderflies...</i>
  - <i>A Massive brawl between Humans True cultists and resistance fighters rages
    as one lone man lies dying by the wall. Loud wailing can be heard from the battle
    but faint words can be heard from the dying man.</i>

    Sam, I guess it won't be long until I see you again\u201D"
  - <i>The recording continues with the man lying lifeless as the battle roars on.</i>
